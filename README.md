# PWR simulation with OpenMC

This repository contains simulations for analyzing neutron flux distribution, criticality, and depletion in a nuclear reactor core using Monte Carlo particle transport methods. The goal is to explore key parameters and reactor designs to achieve and maintain criticality over time, using OpenMC as the primary simulation tool.

#Key Features
Pin Cell and Core Criticality Analysis: Simulate neutron flux and energy distribution to reach criticality in pin cells and core assemblies.
Depletion Modeling: Analyze isotopic changes over six months of operation and observe how U-235 burnup and Pu-239 production affect reactor behavior.
Safety Analysis: Evaluate control rod materials, neutron poisons, and reactor reactivity to design a safer, self-regulating system.
Five Factor Formula Calculations: Assess neutron budget components, including fast fission, thermal utilization, resonance escape, and non-leakage probability.

#Results
Criticality: The critical k-values obtained for the pin cell and core configurations.
Depletion Trends: Changes in U-235, U-238, and Pu-239 over six months of operation.
Neutron Density Validation: Comparison between theoretical and simulated neutron density.
Safety Analysis: Recommended control rod materials and potential neutron poisons.
